## Totistyles Modeling Book
[LIVE DEMO] (currently unavailable)

Personal SSG website created with Nextjs for showcasing my latest work as a growing editorial model.
Includes custom collections with professional pictures and dynamic galleries for browsing and previewing images. 


This repo is currently under construction, meaning there will be upcoming changes for better accessibility, styling, user experience, and other minor fixes.
